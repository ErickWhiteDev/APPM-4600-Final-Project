## About

This repository contains the code for our final paper for APPM 4600, Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing, for the Fall 2024 semester at CU Boulder.
 
## Report

Our final report is available <a href="appm_4600_final_paper.pdf">here</a>. All figures in this paper were created using code available in this repository.

## Data

This code makes use of data from two outside sources. The first is temperature data for Boulder, CO, from January 1st, 2022 to December 31st, 2023; this data is available at https://www.weather.gov/wrh/climate?wfo=bou. The second is magnetometer data from Van Allen Probe A; this data is available at https://emfisis.physics.uiowa.edu/data/index, while the specific data file used in this project is available at https://emfisis.physics.uiowa.edu/Flight/RBSP-A/L2/2014/02/27/rbsp-a_magnetometer_uvw_emfisis-L2_20140227_v1.6.1.cdf.
